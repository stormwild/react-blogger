Interactive blog creation platform built using React, Redux, Node/Express and MongoDB.

Features
- Create an entire blog or post in two clicks. You literally click `New Blog`, type in a title and your blog is created and saved in a database.
- Edit blog posts directly in the browser with a split-screen preview. Type up the content of your post in markup format in the left half of the screen, and see a live preview of the output in the right half, which is so responsive that it responds to every key stroke
- Lightning fast performance. Since the app is built in React, the entire web application is bundled and minified into a file that is smaller than an average JPEG image.
